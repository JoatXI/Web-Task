# Festival Website Project

THE SCENERIO:

It goes without saying that the pandemic was tough for the live entertainment industry
and people in general.

Now, with restrictions lifted, the live entertainment industry is looking to get back on its
feet.

You have been asked to develop a marketing website for a small music festival.
The organisers are giving you a lot of freedom in terms of branding and design, just make
sure the website is themed appropriately.

This is a promotional website – it is not a ticket selling website (assume they will use a
third party for that), thus you need not concern yourself with the selling or booking of
tickets.

There are some core requirements that this website must have (at absolute minimum):
• Line up – It must promote the different acts expected.
• Stages – Like most festivals, it will have multiple stages – each of which have their
own line up. These stages should be represented on the website.
• This event will take place on the 1
st July – This should be very clear on the website!
• An FAQ or advice page – Just a page to inform people of what they can do in advance.
• A contact us page – this must have an appropriate HTML form on it.

TASKS

There are two elements to this project:
• A website – based on the above scenario.
• Supporting documentation – To be submitted as a word or pdf document alongside
the website.

THE WEBSITE

The main element of this project is the development of a website based on the
scenario.

I have provided detailed grading criteria which will state what the website must
do to achieve the different grades.

You must only use the following to develop this website:
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript
• Node JS
  o Express
  o Sqlite3
  o EJS
